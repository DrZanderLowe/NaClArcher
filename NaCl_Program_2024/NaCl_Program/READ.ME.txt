
    Welcome!
    
    Needed programs and libraries:
    - Python 3.10.12
    - Tkinter 8.6
    - MatPlotLib 3.5.1
    
    Manual:
1. To start program:
    -double click front.py file
    -run command in terminal of program dir "python front.py" or "python3 front.py"

2. Basic Calculation button:
    -allows You to see all results of single measurment
    -in text fields write:
        -temperature in Kelwins in place of T[K]
        -pressure in MPa in place of p[MPa]
        -molality in mol*kg-1 in place of M[mol/kg]
    
3. Range Calculation button:
    -allows You to see results for a range of any parameter
    -in text fields write:
        -whole number in place of steps
        -to write a range simply write it in any of below text fields
          e.g.- write "1.5-9.5" instead of just one number for pressure
        -temperature in Kelwins in place of T[K]
        -pressure in MPa in place of p[MPa]
        -molality in mol*kg-1 in place of M[mol/kg]

4. Calculat Button:
    -calculates for parameters that were input by the user
    -for basic calculation the output should show table with results
    -for range calculation the output should show plot with density on y axis and
     parameter that was set as a range on x axis
     
5. Save Button:
    -allows You to save results of calculations
    -for basic calculation it will save the table You see as a result
    -for range calculation it will save a table with parameters T,p,m of each 
     calculation, apparent molar properties, solution property and solvent property
     
     
     Changes made in fortran codes:
     
Changelog for nacl-2.for file:
    -all "alog" functions were changed to "log"
    -added "Continue" to all "Do" loops
    -changed "write(5,...)" to "write(*,...)"
    -changed arrays from static to allocated
    -changed ".eq.0" and ".nq.0" to "abs < 1.0e-26" and "abs > 1.0e-26"
    
Changelog for Steam.for file:     
    -changed HOLLERITH variables into CHARACTER
    -changed types of lists holding previous HOLLERITH variables from DOUBLE-PRECISION
     to CHARACTER
    -changed all types from (2)
    -added variables that werent properly stored (nr1-4, nt1-4, nrmax, ntmax) to 
     locations that required them
    -changed ".eq.0" and ".nq.0" to "abs < 1.0e-26" and "abs > 1.0e-26"
    -commented out "tsave if" statement

Directory "Fortran_core" contains both fortran code files nacl-2.for and Steam.for
